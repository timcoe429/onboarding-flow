Before making ANY HTML/PHP edits:
Read the ENTIRE file section (minimum 50 lines of context)
Count and trace ALL opening and closing div tags
Document which divs open and close where
Verify the complete tag structure before making changes
NEVER include opening tags without their closing tags in the same code block
If replacing content inside divs, NEVER include the wrapper divs in the replacement
FORBIDDEN:
Making changes without seeing the full file structure first
Partial div replacements where opening and closing tags get separated
Assuming structure without verifying with read_file
Quick edits without context
This rule will force me to always analyze the complete HTML structure before making any changes.
