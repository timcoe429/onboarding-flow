MANDATORY RULES FOR THIS PROJECT - BREAK THESE AND YOU'RE USELESS:

HTML/PHP EDITING RULES:
1. BEFORE ANY HTML/PHP EDIT: You MUST use read_file to see at least 50 lines of context FIRST
2. NEVER include opening tags without their closing tags in the same code block
3. COUNT EVERY div/tag before and after changes - they MUST balance
4. If replacing content inside divs, NEVER include the wrapper divs in the replacement
5. ALWAYS trace and document the complete tag structure before making changes
6. When editing forms, VERIFY the entire step structure remains intact

FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
- Partial div replacements where opening and closing tags get separated
- Making changes without seeing the full file section first
- Including <div> in dynamic content without its </div>
- Assuming structure without verifying with read_file
- Quick edits without context
- Adding structural HTML to database content

REQUIRED PROCESS:
1. Read the file section (minimum 50 lines of context)
2. Document which divs open and close where
3. Explain what will change and what stays the same
4. Verify all tags balance after the change
5. Only then make the edit

CRITICAL: THIS IS NOT A LOCAL PROJECT - DO NOT RUN TERMINAL COMMANDS
- User has told me 500+ times this is NOT local
- Never suggest running PHP scripts or terminal commands
- All changes must be made directly to files

PROJECT DOCUMENTATION (READ THESE FIRST):
- PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md: Core plugins, file locations, integration points
- QUICK-REFERENCE.md: Common tasks, file finder, API reference, debug commands
- DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md: Code patterns, testing checklist, common issues
- README.md: Plugin overview and installation

EFFICIENCY RULES:
1. BEFORE coding: Check the relevant documentation file above
2. Use the File Quick Finder table in QUICK-REFERENCE.md to locate files
3. Follow code patterns from DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md
4. Use the provided SQL queries for debugging
5. Reference the API endpoints and functions from QUICK-REFERENCE.md
