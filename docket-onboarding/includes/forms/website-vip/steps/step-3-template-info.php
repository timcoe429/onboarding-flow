    <h2>Website Template Information</h2>
    <p class="step-subtitle">You will now get to select your website template!</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>We will customize your website based on the template you choose, and the information you provide.</p>
        
        <div class="info-section">
            <h5>Customized Website Information</h5>
            <p>Please note that this is not a full custom website, it is a pre-built website theme that we add your content and images to. We do not do any additional design work or custom requests that are not already built into the website theme. This includes but isn't limited to logo design, product image design, adding new pages, adding new sections, and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h5>Sections & Pages Included per Template</h5>
            <p>Once you choose a template, you'll be able to preview the pages and sections included. Please note: the template preview shows exactly what's available â€” we do not add additional pages or sections beyond what is shown.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h5>Revisions to Template</h5>
            <p>Since the website is considered a small website by industry standards, (less than 10 pages) we limit our revision round to 1. You will be notified once your website is ready to be reviewed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h5>Review Period</h5>
            <p>Once your revision round is done (You have 3 full days to fully review the site and add in any changes you see within the scope and theme that you selected) we will make the changes you request that are within the scope we can provide, and then your website will be ready to be pushed live. <strong>Once your website is live, you'll be on our WebsiteVIP plan where our team manages edits to your website.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h5>Charges for Additional/Out of Scope Customizations</h5>
            <p>If you want our team to provide any customizations outside of scope and not included in the theme you chose, such as adding new pages, or if you would like our team to implement edits that you do not include in your review period, will be charged $175/hr for our team to execute these changes during the website build.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <p>The amount paid is only refundable if we have not fulfilled our obligations to deliver the work required under the agreement. The total paid is not refundable if the development work has been started and you terminate the contract or work through no fault of ours, or if you accept ownership of the project transferred to you.</p>
            <p>Once you upgrade to WebsiteVIP, our team can make edits to your website for you as included in the plan.</p>
